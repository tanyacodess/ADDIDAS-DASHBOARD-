I developed an interactive Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard using Excel, featuring multiple pivot tables and visual insights to help understand sales performance across different business dimensions.
The dashboard presents a clear, data-driven overview of Adidas’ sales, enabling stakeholders to quickly track performance trends and make informed decisions.

Allows comparison between regions to understand market strengths and opportunities.
3. Sales by Sales Method

Useful for understanding consumer purchasing behavior.
4. Sales Trend Analysis
A trend chart showing sales patterns over time (monthly/quarterly).
Helps identify seasonality, growth periods, and performance dips.
📈 Impact & Outcome
